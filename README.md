# Twitter Dancer for CrowdTilt

Using Perl Dancer (http://perldancer.org/,https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer), write a web app with these features:

* Given a twitter username, display their most recent tweets (don't hit the twitter api via javascript, but on the backend/perl-side)
* Given two twitter usernames, display the intersection of the people that they follow
* Try to minimize requests to twitter API
